## Definitions

### SOVERIGN BOND 
A government bond or sovereign bond is a form of bond issued by a government to support public spending. It generally includes a commitment to pay periodic interest, called coupon payments, and to repay the face value on the maturity date.

### CREDIT RATINGS/CREDIT RATING AGENCIES
A credit rating is an evaluation of the credit risk of a prospective debtor (an individual, a business, company or a government), predicting their ability to pay back the debt, and an implicit forecast of the likelihood of the debtor defaulting.

CRAs theoretically provide investors with an independent evaluation and assessment of debt securities' creditworthiness.
To determine a bond's rating, a credit rating agency analyzes the accounts of the issuer and the legal agreements attached to the bond to produce what is effectively a forecast of the bond's chance of default, expected loss, or a similar metric.

### Gross domestic product (GDP)
It is a monetary measure of the market value of all the final goods and services produced in a specific time period by a country or countries. GDP is most often used by the government of a single country to measure its economic health.

GDP (PPP) means gross domestic product based on purchasing power parity. 

### Purchasing power parity (PPP) 
It is a popular macroeconomic analysis metric used to compare economic productivity and standards of living between countries.

PPP involves an economic theory that compares different countries' currencies through a "basket of goods" approach. That is, PPP is the exchange rate at which one nation's currency would be converted into another to purchase the same and same amounts of a large group of products.

Some forex traders use PPP to find potentially overvalued or undervalued currencies. And investors who hold stocks or bonds of foreign companies may use the survey's PPP figures to predict the impact of exchange-rate fluctuations on a country's economy, and thus on their investment.

### INFLATION
 Inflation is a rise in prices, which can be translated as the decline of purchasing power over time. The rate at which purchasing power drops can be reflected in the average price increase of a basket of selected goods and services over some period of time.
